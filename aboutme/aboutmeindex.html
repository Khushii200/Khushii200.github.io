            Hey! I’m Khushii Mehta, a second-year design student at FLAME
            University, born and raised in Mumbai. Along with design, I’m also
            studying marketing as my minor—because why not mix creativity with
            strategy, right? When I’m not busy with projects, you’ll probably find
            me out with my camera, capturing life as I travel. I’m all about working
            hard, staying curious, and having fun along the way. As Bunny from Yeh
            Jawaani Hai Deewani says,
